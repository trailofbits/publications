# Guide for Claude when working with this repository

## Repository Guidelines

### Creating PRs
- Always create changes on a new branch (not master)
- Make a PR for changes rather than committing directly to master

### Date Formatting
- Use 3-letter abbreviations for all month names to save space in the layout:
  - Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
  - Do NOT use: January, February, March, April, June, July, August, September, October, November, December
  - Do NOT use 4-letter abbreviations like Sept
