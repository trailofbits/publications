# Guide for Claude when working with this repository

## Repository Guidelines

### Creating PRs
- Always create changes on a new branch (not master)
- Make a PR for changes rather than committing directly to master

### Date Formatting
- Use 3-letter abbreviations for all month names to save space in the layout:
  - Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
  - Do NOT use: January, February, March, April, June, July, August, September, October, November, December
  - Do NOT use 4-letter abbreviations like Sept
- White Papers section: Use only "Mon YYYY" format (no day)
- Other sections may use different formats as appropriate

### Section Organization
- Sections should appear in this order:
  1. Academic Papers
  2. White Papers
  3. Conference Presentations
  4. Guides
  5. Podcasts
  6. Security Reviews
- Within each section, entries should be sorted by date (newest first)
- When checking sort order, be aware that some sections may have subsections that are sorted independently

### Editing Guidelines
- NEVER modify URLs or file paths when making formatting changes
- Preserve the exact order of entries when only changing date formats
- When moving sections, update both the section content AND the table of contents
- Double-check that the total number of table rows remains the same after edits
