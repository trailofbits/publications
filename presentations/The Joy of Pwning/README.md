Sophia D'Antoine is a security engineer at Trail of Bits in NYC and a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She is a regular speaker at security conferences around the world, including RECon, HITB, and CanSecWest. Her present work includes techniques for automated software exploitation and software obfuscation using program analysis. She spends too much time playing CTF and going to noise concerts.

This talk builds on three stages of her technical career growth, what makes them interesting and how they helped her succeed in growing as an expert. These stages are:

1. Hacker Training - The world of Wargames & CTFs
2. Security Engineering & Tooling - Why do it if you can make a program do it
3. Interdisciplinary Research - Turns out security research applies to everything
