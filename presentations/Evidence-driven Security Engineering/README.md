Dan Guido discusses an evidence-driven approach to security engineering, arguing
that security decisions should be grounded in empirical data rather than intuition
or convention. The talk covers how Trail of Bits uses data from hundreds of
security assessments to inform their methodology, identify the most impactful
vulnerability classes, and allocate resources effectively to maximize security
outcomes.
