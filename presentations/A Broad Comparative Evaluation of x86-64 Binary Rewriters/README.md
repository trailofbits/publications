Binary rewriting is a rapidly-maturing technique for modifying software without access to source code. This presentation covers a broad comparative evaluation of ten popular binary rewriters, assessing their generality across a range of input binary classes and the functional reliability of the resulting rewritten binaries. The evaluation also covers performance of the rewriters themselves and identifies input binary features predictive of tool success.
