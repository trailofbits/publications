This talk presents a hybrid control and data flow analysis approach for automatically detecting variability bugs in software. Variability bugs arise when a program's behavior varies unexpectedly based on inputs or environmental conditions, often due to undefined behavior or implementation-specific assumptions. The approach combines control flow and data flow analysis techniques to identify these subtle bugs that are difficult to detect with traditional methods.
