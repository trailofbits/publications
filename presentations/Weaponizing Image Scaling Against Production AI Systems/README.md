This presentation demonstrates how image scaling operations can be weaponized to attack production AI systems, revealing vulnerabilities in common image preprocessing pipelines used by machine learning models. By sending a seemingly harmless image to an LLM, an attacker could trigger unexpected behaviors including data exfiltration through multi-modal prompt injection techniques.
