This presentation shares insights from the Trail of Bits AIxCC team on the risks and opportunities of frontier AI in cybersecurity. Presented as part of a Berkeley RDI workshop convening researchers and practitioners across AI and security, the talk covers lessons learned from DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge, the role of AI in vulnerability discovery and patching, and the evolving balance between AI-enabled offense and defense in cybersecurity.
