In 2016, Stefan gave a talk about how everything in appsec was broken and there was no hope for the future. In the intervening years, he worked in adversary simulation, formal and program analysis, as well as even more threat modeling. This talk is an answer to the problems he presented in 2016, as well as why everything is still broken.
