Symbolic execution is a program analysis technique offering a powerful theoretical foundation for automated testing and verification of programs. Compared to traditional software testing, symbolic execution reasons about numerous executions simultaneously through automatic identification of program semantics. This talk offers a practical introduction to symbolic execution, exploring cutting-edge research in automated software testing along with its strengths, weaknesses, and applications, using Manticore to bridge theory and practice with concrete examples.
