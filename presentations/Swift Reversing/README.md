At WWDC 2014, Apple introduced Swift, their revolutionary new programming language for the future. Since an hour-long presentation discussing Swift class structure and string layouts would be painfully boring, this talk presents a systematic approach to binary reverse engineering new foreign ABIs using Swift as a case study. It covers approaches for identifying control structures and flow, recovering class layouts, mapping machine code patterns to higher level language constructs, and more, leaving attendees with the knowledge and confidence needed to take on any ABIs.
