iOS applications have become increasingly popular targets for hackers, reverse engineers, and software pirates. This presentation discusses the current state of iOS attacks, reviews available security APIs, and reveals why they are not enough to defend against known threats. For high-risk applications, novel protections that go beyond those offered by Apple are required. As a solution, the talk discusses the design of the Mobile Application Security Toolkit (MAST) which ties together jailbreak detection, anti-debugging, and anti-reversing in LLVM to address these risks.
