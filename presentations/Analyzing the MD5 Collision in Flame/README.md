An in-depth analysis of the MD5 collision attack used in the Flame malware to infect machines through Windows Update. Trail of Bits co-founder Alex Sotirov, who was part of the academic collaboration that first demonstrated this class of attacks in 2008, examines the cryptanalytic techniques employed and the implications for MD5-based security systems.
