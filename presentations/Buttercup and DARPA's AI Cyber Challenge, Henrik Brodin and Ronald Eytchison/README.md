This presentation discusses Buttercup, Trail of Bits' automated, AI-powered system for finding and fixing bugs in open-source software, and its success in DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge where it won 2nd place and a $3 million prize. It covers how Buttercup autonomously discovers and patches real vulnerabilities using static analysis and AI-guided fuzzing, the multi-agent architecture, and lessons learned about when AI helps versus hurts.
