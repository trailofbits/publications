## How to fuzz like a pro

This talk presents Echidna - an open source smart contract fuzzer - to build secure smart contracts. In the presentation, we discuss what are code invariants, how to write them, and how to use efficiently Echidna to check them. The goals is to help developers and auditors to understand how property testing work, how to write code security properties, and how to use the fuzzer efficiently.
