This talk presents Echidna, an open-source smart contract fuzzer, and how to use it to build secure smart contracts. The presentation covers what code invariants are, how to write them, and how to efficiently use Echidna to check them. The goal is to help developers and auditors understand how property testing works, how to write code security properties, and how to use the fuzzer effectively for finding vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
