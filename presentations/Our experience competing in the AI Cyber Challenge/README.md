Trail of Bits shares the story of competing in DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC), where their system Buttercup won second place and $3M. The talk covers the team's ups and downs during the competition, how their approach evolved as rules and objectives changed, and key takeaways from building a fully automated cyber reasoning system for securing open-source software.
