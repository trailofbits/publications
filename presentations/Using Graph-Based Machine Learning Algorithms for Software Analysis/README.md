Recent advances in machine learning have created unique opportunities for software analysis that were previously not possible, as ML-based solutions are not bounded by the same computational constraints as traditional techniques. This talk discusses the inherent challenges in using ML for software analysis tools and how exploiting the graph-based nature of software brings success. It presents two graph-based ML tools created under DARPA AIMEE and ReMath programs -- VulChecker for static security testing and CORBIN for lifting advanced mathematical constructs from legacy binary software -- along with guiding principles for applying ML to software.
