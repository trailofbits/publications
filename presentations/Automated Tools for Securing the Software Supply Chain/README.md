This presentation discusses the inherent challenges in securing the software supply chain and the shortcomings of existing approaches. It covers the motivation, design, and implementation of It-Depends and pip-audit, demonstrating how these tools can be used to generate SBOMs and provide insight into the security posture of a given software package.
