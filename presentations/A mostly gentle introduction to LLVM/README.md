A mostly gentle introduction to LLVM
====================================

We're going on a whirlwind tour of LLVM!

In this talk, we'll go from the Clang frontend and its AST, to LLVM IR's syntax
and semantics, to the vagaries of code generation and lowering, and finally to
a collection of things that LLVM wasn't meant to do (but that we'll make it
do anyways).

Presented at:

* UMD-CSEC colloquium, April 2022
