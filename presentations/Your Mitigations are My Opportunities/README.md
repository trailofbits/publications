This talk dives into the Windows implementation of Intel's Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) and the potential attack vectors it introduces, as well as how Protected Process Light (PPL), designed to isolate important processes like anti-malware from the rest of the system, still leaves the door open to some attacks. Security mitigations themselves can introduce new attack surfaces or opportunities for exploitation.
