PrivacyRaven is a comprehensive privacy testing suite for deep learning systems optimized for usability and efficiency. With PrivacyRaven, users can determine the susceptibility of a model to privacy attacks, systematically evaluate different privacy preserving machine learning techniques, develop novel privacy metrics and attacks, and repurpose attacks for data provenance and other use cases. Model extraction, membership inference, model inversion, and other privacy attacks can be quickly prototyped and launched using its modular design.
