This talk reviews a user feature wishlist gathered from interviews with five Silicon Valley tech teams who use osquery. From these, we identified Super Features -- features that would fundamentally improve the value proposition of osquery. The talk explains how these developments could transform osquery's power in technical organizations and walks through the high-level development plans for making these Super Features a reality.
