This talk addresses the state of information security research and the gap between academia and industry. Despite increasingly sophisticated research and millions of dollars in investment, the community still cannot protect against threats and attacks known for over a decade. The presentation examines the lack of collaboration between academia and industry on topics where both sides could benefit, and poses fundamental questions about the future of application security research and how to bridge the divide.
