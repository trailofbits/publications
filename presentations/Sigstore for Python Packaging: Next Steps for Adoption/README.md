Sigstore is coming to the Python packaging ecosystem. For the past 9 months, engineers at Trail of Bits worked with members and stakeholders within the Sigstore community to develop sigstore-python, a high-quality Python API and CLI for performing Sigstore-style signatures and verifications. This talk surveys Python packaging and considers how Sigstore fits into the packaging user experience, with particular consideration for both ordinary users who benefit from baseline authenticity and proactive users who can opt into additional security guarantees.
