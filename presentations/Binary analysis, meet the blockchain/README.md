This talk describes work towards smart contract analysis tooling for Ethereum using symbolic execution. It provides context around both Ethereum and symbolic execution, then discusses the unique technical challenges of combining the two, touching on blockchains, constraint solvers, and virtual machine internals. The talk presents Manticore, an open source symbolic execution tool used to enhance smart contract security audits.
