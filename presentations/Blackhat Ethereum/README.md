This talk introduces smart contract security, presents common vulnerability classes, and demonstrates how to reverse-engineer EVM bytecode to identify vulnerabilities. Nearly all Ethereum code can only be analyzed through reverse engineering, and over the past year enterprising hackers have used flaws in smart contracts to steal millions. The talk also presents tools to support vulnerability discovery in both EVM bytecode and Solidity source code.
