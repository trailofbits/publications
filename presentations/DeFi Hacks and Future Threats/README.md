In light of recent DeFi hacks totaling $50M, this fireside chat explores whether
DeFi has compromised security in order to achieve rapid expansion. Dan Guido joins
Prysm Group's Johnny Antos and Compound's Calvin Liu to discuss the intersection
of technical and economic security in DeFi, the risks of interoperability and
composability creating a "house of cards" equilibrium, and the role of governance
and community engagement in ensuring the long-term economic health of DeFi
protocols.
