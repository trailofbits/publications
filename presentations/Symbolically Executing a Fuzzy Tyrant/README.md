Code reviewers and penetration testers are familiar with normal dynamic and static application security tools (DAST/SAST). However, there are other classes of tools that can provide deeper understanding and more vulnerabilities in the same amount of time. This talk covers two such classes: smart fuzzers and symbolic execution. As a practicum, it focuses on every-day scenarios that normal security analysts face, rather than theoretical attacks in an academic setting.
