Property-based testing is a powerful tool for bug discovery, but it's almost unheard of in the smart contract development community. This talk introduces the concept of property-based testing, discusses strategies for picking good properties and testing them thoroughly, and shows how to apply these ideas to smart contracts using both Manticore and Echidna, with examples of real bugs these tools can find in production code.
