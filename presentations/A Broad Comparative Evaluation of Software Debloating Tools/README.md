Software debloating tools seek to improve program security and performance by removing unnecessary code. This presentation covers a broad comparative evaluation of 10 debloating tools, conducted on a diverse set of 20 benchmark programs across 12 performance, security, and correctness metrics. The evaluation surfaces findings that challenge prevailing narratives in the debloating literature, including low overall success rates and difficulties producing sound programs.
