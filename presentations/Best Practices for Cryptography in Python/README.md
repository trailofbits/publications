Part of what makes Python great also brings challenges for disciplines that need rigorous control of processor execution and memory handling. This talk walks through situations where Python is a wonderful fit and ones where it is a terrible fit for cryptographic operations, carefully examining why in each case. When Python falls short, workarounds and mitigations are discussed. Targeted at any developer who has wondered how to best perform sensitive cryptography-related tasks in Python.
