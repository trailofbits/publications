Over 1.5 million Ethereum smart contracts have been created but fewer than 7,000 unique contracts have value today. This presentation introduces Ethereum smart contracts, explains how to reverse engineer binary-only contracts, describes common vulnerability classes, and shows how to investigate attacks on contracts. It demonstrates new tools that re-process blockchain ledger data, recreate contracts with state, and analyze suspect transactions using traces and heuristics to determine whether a self-destruct was intentional or an attack.
