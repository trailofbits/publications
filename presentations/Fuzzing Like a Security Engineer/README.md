## Fuzzing Like a Security Engineer

This talk presents Echidna, an open source smart contract fuzzer, to build secure smart contracts. In this presentation, we discuss what code invariants are, how to write them, and how to use Echidna to check them. We aim to teach developers and reviewers the basics of property testing, how to write security properties, and how to implement these properties.
