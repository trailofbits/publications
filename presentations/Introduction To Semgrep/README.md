Appsec engineer Maciej Domanski and staff security engineer Matt Schwager guide you on effectively bootstrapping Semgrep, the first section in Trail of Bits' Testing Handbook. Semgrep is a highly efficient static analysis tool for finding low-complexity bugs and locating specific code patterns without building target code. While easy enough for quick initial exploration on an audit, its advanced features permit users to write complex custom rules to identify bugs and concerns specific to a target application or problem space. The session covers basic and advanced usage, integration of Semgrep into continuous testing processes, and how to introduce the tool into your SDLC.
