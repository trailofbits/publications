Over the last 5 years, PyPI has adopted a large number of technologies and standards aimed at improving the integrity of the Python packaging ecosystem: scoped API tokens, security events, strong MFA, Trusted Publishing, and PEP 740 for cryptographic package attestations. This talk hypothesizes and breaks down the next 5 years of changes, from immediately practical efforts to big-picture ideas including index-wide binary transparency, counter attestations, scalable witnessing, TOFU-style identity locking via lockfiles, and using TUF to distribute complex identity policies.
