Trail of Bits participated in the first wide-scale assessment of Kubernetes for the CNCF. This talk relays the unique challenges presented by both Kubernetes, the focus of the assessment, as well as some of the more interesting findings. It presents three over-arching themes of the Kubernetes code base and how these patterns influence the system as a whole.
