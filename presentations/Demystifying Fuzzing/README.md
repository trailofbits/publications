This talk presents the basics of Echidna, an open-source contract fuzzer, to build secure smart contracts. The presentation discusses what code invariants are, how to write them, and how to efficiently use Echidna to check invariants. It aims to help developers and auditors understand how property testing works and how to write effective security properties for their contracts.
