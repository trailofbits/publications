This talk dissects Solidity, the most popular smart contract programming language, demonstrating various examples of its unsafe behavior and showing that even experienced programmers can easily shoot themselves in the foot. The talk serves as a cautionary tale of how not to create a programming language trusted with hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency, and concludes with a retrospective on how these issues could have been avoided. An updated version titled "Fantastic Bugs and How to Squash Them" includes a menagerie of common mistakes and deeply insidious idiosyncrasies, along with a survey of open-source tools for writing secure smart contracts.
