A journey under the hood of Cb LiveOps into the underlying open-source project osquery. This session covers how osquery works, how it can be extended, and how to contribute, including a live code exercise and case study from Trail of Bits. Attendees learn how to use the rich library of existing queries and write effective queries using osquery tables to answer questions for IT, compliance, and security teams.
