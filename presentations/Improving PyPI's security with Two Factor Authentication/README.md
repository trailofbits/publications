Since March, Trail of Bits has worked with the PSF to implement and land major security improvements in Warehouse, the codebase that drives PyPI. This talk covers one of those improvements: the addition of two factor authentication to user logins. Attendees will learn about the technical details of two factor schemes, the security properties they can (and can not) provide, and the process for making major changes to core Python infrastructure.
