# Repeatable Benchmarking: An Exploration of OpenSearch vs Elasticsearch

This talk presents our [work](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/03/06/benchmarking-opensearch-and-elasticsearch/) developing our automated benchmarking framework running OpenSearch Benchmark. Using Github Actions and AWS, we make benchmarking OpenSearch and Elasticsearch easy. Using our framework, we reveal performance inconsistencies and outliers that impacted results. Today, our work continues on newer releases of both platforms, with preliminary findings suggesting improved performance for both engines.
