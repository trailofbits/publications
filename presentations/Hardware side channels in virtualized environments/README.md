This keynote describes the landscape of side-channel vulnerabilities and the types possible given different virtualization circumstances, along with the basic primitives of a side-channel attack. The talk contrasts the general survey against specific exploitation of cloud-based environments, examining the full hardware stack shared between supposedly isolated hosts. It includes demonstrations of two separate attacks, one in the cache and a novel side channel across the pipeline, and reviews possible mitigations at the hardware, hypervisor, and client software levels.
