This talk presents Slither, an open source static analyzer for Solidity with nearly 100 rules that detect common mistakes and security vulnerabilities. It covers how to get the most out of static analysis by using Slither's Python API to analyze program properties such as variable dependencies and state inconsistencies, allowing developers to tailor static analysis to their specific codebase.
