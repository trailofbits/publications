This talk demonstrates how to perform a control flow attack against a complex, stand-alone application using mcsema, LLVM, and satisfiability solvers to discover targeted execution paths via side channel analysis. It covers practical uses of program analysis including instrumentation, symbolic execution, and concolic execution, concluding with a demonstration that solves an obfuscated crackme challenge and a competition between a pintool solver and a pysymemu solver.
