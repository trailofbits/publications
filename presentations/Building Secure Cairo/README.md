This talk shows how to write secure Cairo and StarkNet code, discussing common vulnerabilities, how to fix them, and how to prevent them. It presents the (Not So) Smart Contracts knowledge base, Amarna (an open source static analyzer and linter for Cairo), and the StarkNet Explorer VS Code extension for navigating and auditing StarkNet contracts.
