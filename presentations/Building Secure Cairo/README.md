## Securing Cairo Code

This talk shows how to write secure Cairo and StarkNet code. We discuss common Cairo and StarkNet vulnerabilities, how to fix them, and how to prevent them. For this, we present the (Not So) Smart Contracts knowledge base, Amarna, an open source static-analyzer and linter for Cairo, and release the StarkNet Explorer, a VS Code extension that helps to navigate and audit a StarkNet contract.
