This talk introduces an intelligence-driven approach to malware defense, focusing on attacker capabilities and methods, with data collected from the most popular crimeware packs currently deployed in the wild. The analysis identifies how exploits are developed and selected for inclusion in crimeware packs, identifies defenses that are outside the capability of malware exploit writers to bypass, and helps attendees evaluate not just the exploitability but the probability of a vulnerability being exploited. The original EIP research was conducted while Dan was at iSEC Partners, but the work was revisited at Trail of Bits.
