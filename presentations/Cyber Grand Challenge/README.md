A series of presentations covering Trail of Bits' participation in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge, a contest to automate vulnerability discovery and patching. The talks describe Cyberdyne, a distributed automatic bug-finding system that combines fuzzing, symbolic execution, and binary translation to find and fix bugs in program binaries without human intervention. Topics include the service-oriented architecture that coordinates bug-finding tools, strategies for combining multiple analysis techniques, and approaches to binary patching using LLVM bitcode translation.
