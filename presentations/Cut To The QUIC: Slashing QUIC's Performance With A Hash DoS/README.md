This presentation explores a class of hash-based denial-of-service vulnerabilities in multiple QUIC protocol implementations. The research demonstrates how attackers can significantly degrade QUIC's performance through hash collision attacks. The vulnerability was identified across several actively maintained QUIC libraries, and the talk covers the discovery process, impact analysis, and coordinated disclosure that resulted in multiple CVEs being assigned and fixes deployed.
