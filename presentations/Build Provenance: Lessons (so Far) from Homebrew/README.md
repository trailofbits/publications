For the past 4 months, Trail of Bits has worked with OpenSSF funding and support on build provenance for the Homebrew package manager, the primary package manager for macOS and a source of hundreds of millions of monthly binary downloads. This talk provides an in situ analysis of work in progress, along with key achievements and challenges encountered. It includes a technical dive on Homebrew's architecture and why it is particularly amenable to build provenance, as well as takeaways for similar ecosystems.
