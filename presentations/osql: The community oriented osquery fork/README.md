osql is a community-oriented fork of osquery. Its goals are making the development process more open and predictable, being responsive in reviewing and accepting community contributions, and maintaining the community's confidence and direct participation in the osquery project. This talk discusses how Trail of Bits intends to maintain a successful community fork of a major open-source project.
