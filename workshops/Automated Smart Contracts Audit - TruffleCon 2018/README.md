### Prerequisites

1. Download these exercises. `git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/trufflecon`
2. Install [Echidna](https://github.com/trailofbits/echidna). `docker pull trailofbits/echidna` or try to use [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) (don't use Stack).

### Course content

This is a 3.5 hour workshop on programmatic smart contract security. It describes how to use a fuzzer, [Echidna](https://github.com/trailofbits/echidna/), and a symbolic analysis toolkit, [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore), to review the security of smart contracts and prove correctness of certain functionality.
